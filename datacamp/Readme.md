Some projects that I completed during datacamp "Associate data scientist in python" course. 

Project1: Hypothesis testing in python. Perform a hypothesis test to determine if more goals are scored in women's soccer matches than menâ€™s! Perform an appropriate hypothesis test to determine the p-value, and hence result, of whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's. Use a 10% significance level.

Project2: Supervised machine learning and feature selection to aid farmers in crop cultivation

Project3: Arctic Penguin Exploration: Unraveling Clusters in the Icy Domain with K-means Clustering

Project4:  Tested many different regression models which will help predict the number of days a customer rents a DVD. The model will hopefully make their inventory planning much more efficient by recommending the best-performing model to the company.
